In this project for Walla!Tours web application I have tested a flight search from Tel aviv to Paris to make sure that it shows me results with tickets. 
Tools I used
Java script Module.exports in the page.js to organize my code. 
To manage my buttons/modules, I used locators and selectors through the DevTools. 
Everything was running in the VS Code using WedDriver.
I used Mocha to write the making code in test.e2e.js.



Instructions

1.Install VS code 
2.Instal WedDriver Io(with mocha & spec)
3.Open Walla-Test folder using GitHub 
4.Install node.js (npm will automatically install) 
5.Run npm init --yes to start npm.
6.Then npm install 
7.Open test.e2e.js, open terminal and run 'npm run wdio'
